# Scalar RPG Utilities

A lightweight RPG-focused spin-off of Scalar Utils for Minecraft 1.21.1.

Inspired by RPG Inventory (older versions) and built as a small mod extension that provides Curios-based wearable items and crafting materials to add RPG-style buffs to players.

## Features
### Curios items
- Gloves (1 per player): grant a single buff depending on glove material and the material's tier.
- Necklace (1 per player): grants a single buff depending on necklace material and the material's tier.
- Rings (2 per player): grant a single buff depending on ring material and the material's tier.

### Items and crafting materials
- Burnisher: a tool used to shape raw gems into usable forms. Higher-tier Burnishers produce higher-quality gems.
- Tier 1–3 Gems (used in crafting Curios items):
  - Diamond: Regeneration buff
  - Emerald: Various buffs 
    - Nullifies negative potion effects
    - Haste buff
    - Resistance buff
  - Gold: Swiftness buff
