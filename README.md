# Scalar RPG Utilities

A lightweight RPG-focused spin-off of Scalar Utils for Minecraft 1.21.1.

Inspired by [RPG Inventory](https://github.com/AbsolemJackdaw/Rpg-Inventory-2016) (older versions) and built as a small mod extension that provides Curios-based wearable items and crafting materials to add RPG-style buffs to players.

## Features
### Curios Items
- Gloves (1 per player): Grant a single buff depending on glove material and the component's tier. 
- Necklace (1 per player): Grants a single buff depending on necklace material and the component's tier.
- Rings (2 per player): Grant a single buff depending on ring material and the component's tier.

*With some exceptions for special materials.*

### Items and Crafting Materials
- Burnisher: a tool used to shape raw resources into usable forms (called components). Higher-tier Burnishers produce higher-quality gems.
- Tier 1–3 Components (used in crafting Curios items):
  - Diamond: Regeneration buff
  - Emerald: Various buffs 
    - Nullifies negative potion effects
    - Haste buff
    - Resistance buff
  - Gold: Swiftness buff
  - Lapis Lazuli: Strength buff
